# Grading Rubrics

## How It Works
All rubrics are scored on 5-point scales, based on the following grade equivalents:

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F | D | C | B | A | A+ |

To compute your numerical grade based on rubric scores, we will first calculate the mean score across dimensions, round to one decimal point, and then convert the score to a percentage based on the following conversion table:

| 0.0 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 4.5 | 5.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0%  | 50% | 60% | 70% | 80% | 90% | 100% |

Some examples of how this works:
- your mean is 1.75; your grade is 50% of the available points for that assignment
- your mean is 1.98; your grade is 60% of the available points (because 1.98 rounds to 2.0)
- your mean is 4.4; your grade is 80% of the available points
- your mean is 4.9; your grade is 90% of the available points

### Introduction

| Score | Criteria |
|:---:  |---    |
|**5**  | Clearly introduces the experiment, research question, and hypotheses with strong context and relevance.  |
|**4**  | Introduces the experiment and research question; hypotheses are present but may lack clarity or depth.  |
|**3**  | Basic introduction with minimal explanation of research question or hypotheses.  |
|**2**  | Introduction is unclear or missing key components.  |
|**1**  | Introduction is missing most of the key components (e.g., research question and hypotheses)  |
|**0**  | Introduction is missing or contains irrelevant content.  |

### Analysis

| Score | Criteria |
|:---:  |---    |
|**5**  | Thorough explanation of data cleaning and organization process; demonstrates strong understanding and rationale.  |
|**4**  | Good explanation of data cleaning and organization; some rationale provided.  |
|**3**  | Basic description of process; lacks depth or clarity. |
|**2**  | Minimal or unclear explanation of data handling. |
|**1**  | Disorganized explanation of the data cleaning and analysis, does not describe their process.  |
|**0**  | No explanation of data cleaning or analysis.  |

### Discussion of Results

| Score | Criteria |
|:---:  |---    |
|**5**  | Insightful interpretation of results; connects findings to research question and hypotheses effectively.  |
|**4**  | Clear discussion of results; some connection to research question and hypotheses.  |
|**3**  | Basic discussion; limited interpretation or connection to research question.  |
|**2**  | Results are presented without meaningful discussion or interpretation.  |
|**1**  | Results are unclear and missing the interpretation of the findings. |
|**0**  | No discussion of the results. |

### Coding Reflection

| Score | Criteria |
|:---:  |---    |
|**5**  | Deep reflection on coding experience; thoughtful insights on Copilot-generated code, challenges, and lessons learned.   |
|**4**  | Good reflection; mentions Copilot and challenges with some insights.  |
|**3**  | Basic reflection; limited discussion of Copilot or challenges.  |
|**2**  | Reflection is superficial or missing examples.  |
|**1**  | Minimal reflection is made and/or is unclear. |
|**0**  | No reflection provided. |

### Conclusion

| Score | Criteria |
|:---:  |---    |
|**5**  | Strong summary that ties together all sections; reinforces key takeaways and implications.  |
|**4**  | Clear summary; touches on main points.  |
|**3**  | Basic conclusion; may miss some key takeways (e.g., the findings).  |
|**2**  | Conclusion is unclear and does not summarize the key takeways.  |
|**1**  | A conclusion is barely made with little attempt to summarize the project.  |
|**0**  | No conclusion is provided.  |

### Presentation Skills

| Score | Criteria |
|:---:  |---    |
|**5**  | Clear, engaging delivery; excellent pacing, and visuals.  |
|**4**  | Good delivery; mostly clear and engaging with appropriate visuals.  |
|**3**  | Adequate delivery; some issues with clarity or engagement.  |
|**2**  | Poor delivery; difficult to follow and/or lacking visuals.  |
|**1**  | Little effort in presentation and/or is often unclear.  |
|**0**  | No effort in presentation and/or completely unclear.  |
